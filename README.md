# About Me 👩🏼‍🎤

I'm Gina. I have Swift and iOS apps on my mind everyday. My tech bffs are Google search & Stackoverflow. Off the technical clock I'm doing one of my hobbies below: 

- Making killer beef jerky 🤠
- Playing ice hockey 🏒
- Working on my bbq pit master skills 🥩
- Re-watching Adventure Time episodes 🌈
